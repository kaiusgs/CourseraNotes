## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)  
- Phases  
![sdlc_phases](./static/04/sdlc_phases.png)  
- Requirements  
![requirements](./static/04/requirements.png)  
- Requirements Documentation  
    ![requirements_documentation](./static/04/requirements_documentation.png)  
    - An SRS is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance.  
    - A URS is a subset of the SRS that details user specification requirements.  
    - The SysRS contains the same information as an SRS, but can also additionally include system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria.  
- Releases  
![releases](./static/04/releases.png)  
- Version Numbers

- Testing:  
    ![testing](./static/04/testing.png)  
    - Functional testing is concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test.  
    - Non-functional testing tests for attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and availability.  
    - Regression testing confirms that a recent change to the application, such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality.  
## Tools  
- Building Tools  
![building_tools](./static/04/building_tools.png)  
- Packages  
![packages](./static/04/packages.png)  
![package_managers](./static/04/package_managers.png)  
- Software Stack  
    - LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP  
    - MEAN: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js  
    - MEVN: MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js  
## Programing  
- Assembly Language: Low-level programming language  
![assembly_language](./static/04/assembly_language.png)  
## Architecture  
- Architecture design: how components interact, operating environment, design principles. Early design decisions are costly to change once implemented. Addresses non-functional aspects.  
- Component Characteristics  
![component_characteristics](./static/04/component_characteristics.png)  
- Application Implementation Layers: Services are made of components and components consist of objects.  
![application_implementation_layers](./static/04/application_implementation_layers.png)  
- Distributed Systems  
![distributed_systems](./static/04/distributed_systems.png)  
- Architectural Patterns  
    - Some patterns can be combined in a single system, but some are mutually exclusive.  
    ![types_of_architectural _patterns](./static/04/types_of_architectural_patterns.png)  
    - 2-Tier: Client-Server (usually more than one client)  
    - 3-Tier: Presentation Tier, Application Tier, Data Tier  
    - Peer to Peer (P2P): Peer Nodes  
    - Event Driven: Producer -> Router -> Consumer  
    - Microservices: Client -> API Gateway -> Services(Orchestration handles the communication)  
- Application Deployment Environments  
    ![pre_production_environments](./static/04/pre_production_environments.png)  
- Product Deployment Components

## Ethics  
- Code of Ethics: 8 principles  
    > Use in conjunction with conscientious dicision-making and common sense.  
    > Knowing where to apply principles is at the discretion and wisdom of the individual.
